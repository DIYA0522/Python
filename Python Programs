Weight converter program

weight = int(input('Weight:'))                                           here int() convert return value of input() fn to numerical
unit = input('(L)bs or (K)g:')
if unit.upper() == 'L':
    converted = weight * 0.45                                            so we cannot multiple a string(weight) with a floating-point value(0.45), so weight is converted to a numerical value first
    print(f'You are {converted} kilos')                                   formatted string f"{}"
else:
    converted = weight / 0.45
    print(f'You are {converted} pounds')

while condition:
     ...........
     ...........

In this case whatever code we write inside this block will continuously execute until condition is True

i = 1                        i initialised to 1
while i<=5:                  python interpreter interprets line 2        
  print(i)                   prints i
  i=i+1                      increments i,         until i<=5 bloack executes, then gets out
print("Done")

Simple Guessing game using while loop

secret_number = 9
guess_count = 0
guess_limit = 3
while guess_count < guess_limit:
    guess = int(input("Guess:"))
    guess_count += 1
    if (guess == secret_number):
        print('You won!')
        break
else:
    print("You failed 3 guesses")


Like if can have an optional else, while can also have an else block.
Here after while block gets completed(after 3 guess done) else loop gets executed.
Before that if user gives correct input, gets out of if statement by break condition.
