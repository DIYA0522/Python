Fundamentals of Python

variables used to store data in computer's memory.
ex; student_count = 1000;
intepreter will allocate a memory for this and store 1000.
so this abel can be used anytime to access this memory location.

types of data that can be stored.
Built in primitive types
Numbers
Boolean
Strings

ex; student_count = 1000      --integrer
ex; student_count = 10.34     --float
ex; is_published = True       --boolean
ex; course_name = "Python Programming"    --string

python is a case sensitive language
Accepted boolean values
False
True

triple quotes used in order to define a big message 
say
Message = """
This is an automate message
Kindly Ignore !!!
"""


Function is a reusable piece of code used to carry out tasks
Built in Functions in Python

len funtion. used to get the length of ur string
always followed by parenthesis to indicate its a function
len() -- indicating we are calling this function

some functions take additional data called arguments
these arguments are inputs to this functions

course = "Python Programming"
print(len(course)) -- will print the number of characters in that string

index of first haracter is 0

print(len(course[0]))  ---1
print(course[0])       ---P

negavtive take from the end of the string
print(course[-1])       ---g

slice / extract 
print(course[0:3])        --Pyt
print(course[0:])          --gives exact same Python Programming
print(course[:3])          --Pyt
print(course[:])           --gives exact same Python Programming
